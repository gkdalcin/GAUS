# GAUS v1.1

Release Date: 9th july 2021

## What's New?
* Now there are only two files: one for systems composed of points and lines and another for systems only composed of points.
* The user can select which metrics will be calculated in the analysis using the _Metrics to be Computed_ field in the execution window.
* More than one field can be selected in the Load, Supply and Demand fields. When multiple fields are selected, the corresponding attribute will be equal to the sum of all these selected fields.
* In the file for Points+Lines Systems, a new field called _Distance Precision_ was added for the user to define a max distance between points and lines' ends for them to be considered as connected.
* The nomenclature of the output columns was changed, check it on the [GAUS documentation](https://github.com/gkdalcin/GAUS/wiki).
