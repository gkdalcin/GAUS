# GAUS: Graph Analysis of Urban Systems

GAUS is a set of scripts for calculating configurational metrics in QGIS that was developed in the [Urban Systems Research Group](https://www.ufrgs.br/sistemas-urbanos/en/) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in Brazil. It contains configurational models conceived by professor [Romulo Krafta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Romulo-Krafta), and it was programmed by masters student [Guilherme Dalcin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guilherme-Dalcin).
